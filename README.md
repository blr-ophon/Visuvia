## Requirements

- tkinter
- matplotlib
- pyserial

## Running

```bash
  python main.py --gui 
```
or 

```bash
  python main.py --cmd
```

## Usage

Use the MCTP api (still to be documented) on your MCU to communicate with visuvia.
GUI allows data visualization in real time, cmd saves  received data to csv and text files.
